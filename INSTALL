- LanChat v1.3.0 INSTALL

The recommended way to build LanChat is by using Maven.
If you don't have Maven, download from http://maven.apache.org/

To compile, stay in the root folder where pom.xml is, and run:
'mvn clean package'

That's it! You should have a ready-to-use lanchat-1.3.0.jar file
in the target folder.

Have fun! :)

- LanChat v1.3.0 Frequently Asked Questions


1. LanChat crashed, doesn't connect, or behaves strangely.

First, make sure you are using the latest version. When you do, the easiest
way to find the problem is for you to run LanChat from the console, like this:
'java -jar LanChat-x.x.x.jar'

If you see any errors, write them down. If nothing of interest shows up,
then you can try enabling debug output by running LanChat like this:
'java -jar LanChat-x.x.x.jar --debug'


2. I minimized LanChat, and it's not visible on the taskbar anymore.

Have a look in the system tray. There should be a small black and white icon
there with a cow pattern. Click on it to open LanChat again.


3. How do I change my nick name?

Open the Tools menu, and choose Settings.


4. How do I send files?

Right click on a user in the user list on the right side, and choose
"Send file". You can also drag and drop a file on a user in the list,
or in a private chat window.


5. How do I open a private chat?

You can double click on a user in the user list, or you can right click on a
user in the user list and choose "Private chat".


6. The file chooser is horribly slow in Windows XP.

This is a Java bug, see
http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6578753
As a workaround you can move any zip-files lying on the desktop
to some other folder.


7. How do I enable console mode?

From a console, run LanChat like this:
'java -jar LanChat-x.x.x.jar --console'
See /help for a list of commands you can use while in console mode.


8. How come some messages don't show up in other clients?

That's probably because of packet loss. LanChat uses the UDP protocol,
which does not resend lost packets. Packet loss is usually not a problem
in wired networks, but wireless networks might have some loss.


9. Where do the log files go?

The logs are put in the ~/.LanChat/logs/ folder, sorted by date and time
of creation. For those wondering, ~ means home folder.

Examples:

* Windows XP - C:\Documents and Settings\Your Username\.LanChat\logs\
* Windows Vista - C:\Users\Your Username\.LanChat\logs\
* Linux - /home/username/.LanChat/logs/


10. Why do non-ascii characters look wrong when using console mode in Windows?

That's because the Windows console uses the old DOS character sets instead of
the normal Windows character sets. A common DOS charset is cp850 and a
common Windows charset is cp1252. I've found 2 ways to go around this problem:

* Change the console charset to match the Windows charset.
  If your Windows charset is cp1252, just run the command 'chcp 1252' before
  starting LanChat like normal. For this to work you need a console font
  which supports the chosen charset, like Lucida Console.

* Change the Java charset to match the console charset.
  You can get the current console charset by running the command 'chcp'.
  Then use the charset number when starting LanChat:
  'java -Dfile.encoding=850 -jar LanChat-x.x.x.jar --console'.


11. Why don't I have the Nimbus look and feel?

Nimbus is a new look and feel that comes with Java 6 update 10 and newer.
If you don't see Nimbus in the list, then you need to update to the
newest version of Java.


12. Where can I find an icon to use for shortcuts?

There is an icon available inside LanChat-x.x.x.jar, in two different
formats:

* kou_shortcut.ico
* kou_shortcut.png

To find these, you can just open the jar file in a decompression utility
like WinZip or 7-Zip.


13. Which smileys are available?

14. Why is the window sometimes only maximized vertically or horizontally
after being unhidden from the system tray?

I don't know! But I'm unable to reproduce the problem using early
versions of Java 7, so I'm guessing it's not my bug ;)


15. I have a great suggestion for a new feature. What do I do?

Cool :) Just register the suggestion on the issue tracker at
http://LanChat.googlecode.com/ with "feature request" in the title.


16. LanChat uses the wrong network interface. How can I switch?

Typical use cases include:

* You want to connect to the wired network by default, but LanChat keeps
  connecting to the wireless network.
* LanChat connects using a "fake" network interface that ships with
  virtualization software like VMware and Virtual Box.

You can override the network interface chosen by LanChat in the settings.
Choose one in the list and click OK to switch. Tip: hold the mouse over
each of the items in the drop down list for more details about the network
interface, if available.


17. How can I get LanChat to open in front of other applications after
being unhidden from the system tray in KDE?

The window manager in KDE is usually configured with a feature called
"Focus stealing prevention". This feature keeps new windows from opening
in front and stealing focus. However, when unhiding LanChat from the
system tray it's because one wants to interact with that window, and this
focus stealing prevention gets in the way.

It can be disabled globally or per application. Here is how to disable for
LanChat only:

Right click on the title bar of the LanChat window, then click on
"Advanced/Special Application Settings...". Go to the rightmost tab,
called something like "Workarounds" or "Appearance & Fixes"
(depends on the version of KDE). Enable the checkbox on
"Focus stealing prevention", and set it to "Force" and "None" in the 2
drop down lists, then click OK to save.


18. Which ports do I need to have open in the firewall?

If your firewall is blocking network traffic then LanChat will show the text
"Not connected" in the title bar. The following ports needs to be open for
everything to work correctly:

* Main chat: UDP port 40556
* Private chat: UDP port 40656 (increased by one for each running instance)
* File transfer: TCP port 40756
* Network detection: UDP port 50050
